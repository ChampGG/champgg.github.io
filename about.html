        <h3>The Basics</h3>
        <p><strong>PugChamp</strong> was conceived in December 2015 as a successor to <em>tf2pug.me</em>, a similar web-based draft-organized PUG system. It aimed to not only recreate the same functionality but add to it with features like ratings and automated servers.</p>
        <p>After a rapid month of development, the service went into open alpha in late January 2016. Rapid testing and refinements let the system move into beta in mid-February, where it currently sits as further enhancements and changes are made to perfect the concept.</p>

        <h3>Support</h3>
        <p>Running a complex system like PugChamp isn't free, and we could always use some help to keep the servers running.</p>
