                <p>By being a member of the Pro League, a player is recognized as one of the best and a potential role model, and is thus expected to live up to the highest standards of courtesy and integrity in their interactions with the PugChamp systems and community.</p>
                <p>Players who are unable to follow these expectations will receive appropriate consequences, including possible suspension or expulsion from the Pro League.</p>

                <p class="text-faded">Cheating (defined as <em>attempting to obtain and utilize an unfair advantage against other players</em>) is a serious violation of competitive integrity and cannot be tolerated.</p>

A team will then review all available evidence (including any submitted by the player) to determine the player's guilt. If cheating is determined to be probable, the player will be permanently banned.</p>

                    <strong>Q: Under what circumstances can I override someone to play in a role they did not add as?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A: It depends on the situation. In general, if there is a role with no players left except for overrides, the captain should take on that role. However, in certain cases an override may be desirable in order to make the game better. (Note that medic overrides are disabled and a captain must play medic if none are left to pick.) Any captain who attempts to abuse the override system may be restricted.

                <p>
                    <strong>Q: Under what circumstances am I allowed to play other roles?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A: Generally, you should play the role you were drafted to play. The one recognized exception is offclassing (from scout or roamer) in order to attack or defend the final control point. Players who are deemd to be excessively offclassing may be restricted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Q: Under what circumstances can I let a draft expire as captain?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A: Captains should not allow drafts to expire with very rare exceptions. A captain intentially allowing a draft to expire may be restricted.
